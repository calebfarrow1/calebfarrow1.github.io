There are some really important graphs out there. Here are some types of important types or classifications of graphs.

<b><em>Definition.</em></b> A graph is called <em>complete</em> if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Complete graphs are denoted $K_n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph.

Something to note about complete graphs is that they're as dense as possible. In applied math, we really don't want to deal with graphs that are close to complete graphs because they're absolutely hellish to store and run any algorithm on. We like sparse graphs, and these will return in the future (who said there isn't any foreshadowing in nonfiction).

<b><em>Definition</em></b> The empty graph on $n$ vertices is the complement of $K_n$.
