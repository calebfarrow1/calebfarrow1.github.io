Not all graphs are simple. Sometimes, we need to model systems where the flow of information (or whatever else) isn't necessarily reciprocal. Notice that the only thing that will change in the way we define a directed graph is the way we make sense of edges. Godsil and Royle take to calling directed edges arcs. I'll do the same thing.

<b><em>Definition.</em></b> A <em>directed graph</em> $X$ has a vertex set $V(X)$ and an arc set $A(X)$, which consists of ordered pairs of vertices.

Directed graphs aren't super important in pure math, but they're really important in computer science among other applications. Many of the pretty results we'll uncover about simple graphs won't extend to directed graphs because of this lack of reciprocal information flow.
